    "A dataset from kaggle was employed for this task. The dataset contains information between 2012-10-01 and 2015-08-27 about a coffee chain company. Based on the dataset, the company wants to carry out a simple analysis regarding their sales and profit for all of their available branches within the given period. They want to see how much they are earning and also how much they are spending to keep the coffee chains running smoothly and attracting customers.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset has the variable names Area Code, Cogs, DifferenceBetweenActualandTargetProfit, Date, Inventory Margin, Margin, Market_size, Market, Marketing, Product_line, Product_type, Product, Profit, Sales, State, Target_cogs, Target_margin, Target_profit, Target_sales, Total_expenses, and Type.\n",
    "\n",
    "The numerical variables in the dataset that the company is interested in examining are Cogs, DifferenceBetweenActualandTargetProfit, Margin, Profit, Sales, Target_cogs, Target_margin, Target_profit, Target_sales, and Total_expenses. For these variables, the Cogs variable shows the cost of goods sold, the DifferenceBetweenActualandTargetProfit shows the actual profit subtracted by the target profit, the Margin is the percentage of profit earned from sales, the Profit is the profit earned by the coffee chain, the Sales shows the revenue earned, the Target_cogs shows the target for Cost of Goods Sold, the Target_margin is the target margin, the Target_profit shows the target profit, the Target_sales is the target sales and finally the Total_expenses shows the total expenses spent for running the coffee chain.\n",
    "\n",
    "Firstly, the company checks sales for the coffee chains based on the Sales column and compares it with the target sales in the Target_sales column. The minimum sales is 21 and the maximum sales is 815 while the minimum target is 0.0 and the maximum target is 960.0. The median sales is 133 and the median target is 120. This may indicate that most coffee chains earned 133 in sales which is similar to the median target. However, based on common knowledge, the minimum sales is pretty low despite no coffee chain getting lower than the minimum target. This may indicate that there are coffee chains that experienced loss. The maximum sales is also very high. The skewness value for sales, 1.7564, indicates that quite a few coffee chains earned high sales meanwhile the rest of the coffee chains still earned similar values to the average sales which is 191 with a standard deviation of 148.27. Compared to the average target, 168.4934, the coffee chains did pretty well on average. The kurtosis is 2.7672 which indicates that there are extreme values which means that some coffee chains have a sales value that is very different from the majority of the coffee chains and there may be some coffee chains earning less or more than average.\n",
    "\n",
    "The company now wants to identify whether there are losses experienced by their coffee chains. To check, the company refers to the Profit column to see if there are any coffee chains experiencing loss. Based on the output, the minimum value is -605 and maximum value is 646. The negative value shows that there are coffee chains that experienced loss. In comparison to the Target_profit column, the minimum and maximum values are -320 and 470 respectively. The range of profit is wider than the range of target profit. The median of profit is 39.5 which means most of the coffee chains earned profit similar to the median of the target profit which is 40.0. The distribution of the profit has a skewness of 0.28231, a kurtosis of 8.973741, and a mean of 60.5565. The skewness indicates that there is generally a normal distribution but the kurtosis shows there are values that are extreme and vary greatly from the mean with a standard deviation of 100.5166.\n",
    "\n",
    "The company also wants to check what factors may possibly be affecting the coffee chain with the highest and lowest profits. It was detected that the coffee chain with the lowest profit was located in an area with a small market size and only earned 33 in sales despite spending 111 on marketing. The margin, -294, also indicates that the profit percentage earned from their sales are extremely low. Next, the coffee chain with the highest profit had a major market size and a margin of 526. This means that they earned a large profit from the sales they made. They also spent only 66 on marketing which saved them cost. The company decides to look into this problem further in the future.\n",
    "\n",
    "After checking the profit and sales for the coffee branches, the overall performance of the company should be evaluated. The company decides to examine the DifferenceBetweenActualandTargetProfit column. On average, the company barely passed their target profit by an average of 0.387 with a standard deviation of 44.3311. The median is -3.0 which shows that the majority of the coffee chains did not pass their profit. The minimum and maximum values are -369 and 249 respectively. The distribution is skewed to the left and has leptokurtic distribution showing that the coffee chains dominantly did not pass their target profit and there are extreme values. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now the company wants to check the cost of goods sold (Cogs) against the target cost of goods sold. To do so, the company compares the Cogs and Target_cogs columns respectively. It seems like both the minimum for Cogs and Target_cogs are 0.00. The maximum for Cogs is 294 meanwhile the maximum Target_cogs is 380. The median Cogs is 57.0 and the median Target_cogs is 50.0. The average Cogs is 82.4 while the average Target_cogs is 71.68. This means that on average, the coffee branches passed their target cost of goods sold. Cogs has a skewness of 1.5370 and a kurtosis of 1.6090 showing that there are coffee chains that have higher values of Cogs compared to the average.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, the company wants to know the total expenses the coffee chains spent using the Total_expenses column. The minimum and maximum expenses are 11 and 156 respectively. The median is 46 and the average is 53.84 with a standard deviation of 31.70. This indicates that most coffee chains spent around the average value to keep the coffee chain running. The distribution is skewed to the right by 2.1775 and has a kurtosis of 1.0635 showing that there are a few coffee chains that are spending more than the average.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the company examines the Margin and Target_margin columns to compare the percentage of profit and the target profit percentage. The minimum and maximum for the Margin is -294 and 526 meanwhile the minimum and maximum for Target_margin is -210 and 580. The median margin is 73 and the median target margin is 70. The mean margin is 102.42 and the mean target margin is 96.82. The median and mean indicates that most coffee chains passed the target margin. Both the margin and the target margin have a leptokurtic distribution and are skewed to the right. This means that there are extreme values towards the right side of the graph indicating that there are coffee chains with high margin and target margin values.\n",
    "\n",
    "To conclude, the company did well where they mostly reached their targets in most areas. Regardless, they still have some coffee chains that need proper management so that they do not overspend on marketing but not gain sales. The company may do further analysis to identify which coffee chains need more management to avoid making the wrong decisions or to move the coffee chains location to a more populated area with larger market size."
